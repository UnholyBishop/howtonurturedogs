<p style="text-align: center; color:aquamarine; font-size: 60px;">#1: PLAYTIME! 
Most dogs love to play well past puppyhood. This didn’t happen by chance; a dog’s lifelong juvenile tendencies (called neoteny) are a result of the domestication process. So playing around isn’t just a fun distraction—it’s hardwired in his DNA. Have fun getting on the ground, running around, playing hide-and-seek, or coming up with your own special games to satisfy this basic doggy instinct.<br>
#2: TAKE A WALK
As our lives become busier, it becomes easier to let the dog out in the fenced backyard to “exercise himself.” But taking your dog for a walk is one of the best ways to keep him fit and release some excess energy. He will be endlessly fascinated by the smells, sights, and sounds of your neighborhood. It will give you both a chance to socialize with others, and you may even make some new friends on your block.<br>
#3: TOY TIME
An amazing assortment of toys is available for your dog. From simple balls to more complicated “brain games,” a toy can bring hours of fun to your best friend. It will occupy his time when you aren’t around and give you a chance to play together when you are. Just be sure that any toys you purchase are safe and durable.<br>
#4: DOGGY PLAY DATES 
We’ve all heard of play dates among children, but have you thought of arranging one for your dog? Doggy play dates are a great way to socialize your pup—plus he gets to have a good time playing around with a canine friend. Whether you meet at a favorite dog park or just in your backyard, a doggy play date is sure to please him.<br>
#5: HUMAN PLAY DATES
Why not take your pet out for a jaunt where he’ll meet other dog-loving humans? Dog-friendly public spaces are becoming more common. Do an Internet search of your surrounding area and you might be surprised by how many places you can take your dog. Certain parks, beaches, and pet stores all often welcome dogs with open paws. Just make sure that your dog is leashed and trained appropriately for public outings.<br>
