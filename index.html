<h1> How to Care for Dog(s) </h1>    
<p style="color: aqua; text-align: center; font-size: 60px;">There are few things in the world that give us more pleasure than our pets. After all, the word “dog” is synonymous with loyalty, devotion, and love. But do you show your dog how much you cherish him on a daily basis? Take a moment to consider these “top 10” ways to support the dog who plays such an important role in your life.<br>  
#3: GROOMING
You might think of grooming your dog as just another chore on your “to-do” list. However, a quiet brushing session can keep your canine looking spotless and strengthen your bond. It will give you a chance to look over his coat and skin to check for any potential health issues, and your dog will love the attention.<br>
#4: SPADE/NEUTERING
Spaying or neutering your pet has numerous health benefits, including preventing certain cancers and other medical problems. And there are behavioral benefits as well, especially with neutered male dogs, who are less likely to mark or roam. As an added bonus, you won’t add to the overpopulation of unwanted pets that already exists in the United States.<br>
#5: FOOD TREATS
Many dogs are food motivated, and chances are your pup is one of them! Giving your dog a delicious treat is a great way to let him know you care. If he’s at a healthy weight, then the occasional snack is just fine. If your dog needs to lose a few pounds, you can still give him a healthy option (like a baby carrot) so as not to exacerbate the problem.
Step 2- Playing with the dog(s)
#1: PLAYTIME! 
Most dogs love to play well past puppyhood. This didn’t happen by chance; a dog’s lifelong juvenile tendencies (called neoteny) are a result of the domestication process. So playing around isn’t just a fun distraction—it’s hardwired in his DNA. Have fun getting on the ground, running around, playing hide-and-seek, or coming up with your own special games to satisfy this basic doggy instinct.<br>
#2: TAKE A WALK
As our lives become busier, it becomes easier to let the dog out in the fenced backyard to “exercise himself.” But taking your dog for a walk is one of the best ways to keep him fit and release some excess energy. He will be endlessly fascinated by the smells, sights, and sounds of your neighborhood. It will give you both a chance to socialize with others, and you may even make some new friends on your block.<br>
#3: TOY TIME
An amazing assortment of toys is available for your dog. From simple balls to more complicated “brain games,” a toy can bring hours of fun to your best friend. It will occupy his time when you aren’t around and give you a chance to play together when you are. Just be sure that any toys you purchase are safe and durable.<br>
#4: TRAINING
Training your dog is a wonderful way to nurture him. Well-trained dogs end up spending more time with the family and are welcomed more places than untrained dogs are. A trained dog is a pleasure to be around, and he’ll benefit from those positive feelings.<br>
Step 3- Bathing the pet
Paragraph- Giving your dog a bath is one of the best ways to keep it looking and smelling good. Long-haired dogs, in particular, benefit from a thorough cleaning at least once a month. Here are some tips on how to bathe your dog without it turning into a wet, soapy struggle.<br>
