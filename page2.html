<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 80px;">Caring For Dog(s) </h1>   
<p style="text-align: center; color:aquamarine; font-size: 60px;">There are few things in the world that give us more pleasure than our pets. After all, the word “dog” is synonymous with loyalty, devotion, and love. But do you show your dog how much you cherish him on a daily basis? Take a moment to consider these “top 10” ways to support the dog who plays such an important role in your life.<br>  
#1: GROOMING
You might think of grooming your dog as just another chore on your “to-do” list. However, a quiet brushing session can keep your canine looking spotless and strengthen your bond. It will give you a chance to look over his coat and skin to check for any potential health issues, and your dog will love the attention.<br>
#2: SPADE/NEUTERING
Spaying or neutering your pet has numerous health benefits, including preventing certain cancers and other medical problems. And there are behavioral benefits as well, especially with neutered male dogs, who are less likely to mark or roam. As an added bonus, you won’t add to the overpopulation of unwanted pets that already exists in the United States.<br>
#3: FOOD TREATS
Many dogs are food motivated, and chances are your pup is one of them! Giving your dog a delicious treat is a great way to let him know you care. If he’s at a healthy weight, then the occasional snack is just fine. If your dog needs to lose a few pounds, you can still give him a healthy option (like a baby carrot) so as not to exacerbate the problem.<br>
